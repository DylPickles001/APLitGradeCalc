# APLitGradeCalc
A grade calculator I made for my AP Lit class as our grades are typically hidden until the end of a quarter.
I personally got inspired to make this program since my friends and I were anxious on what our grades were in our AP Lit class and this came into fruition.
On AERIES, we could see the various percentages that we had in certain categories of our overall grade.
The Overall Grade, the hidden area that we all wanted to see, could be determined by calculating the weights of the categories on the overall grade by the percentages that we had in order to fully determine our overall grade.

In short, this is basically a calculator to calculate the overall grade for users in the AP Literature class at my school based on the percentages that we have on AERIES grade portal, which the user inputs 

# Improvements to make
If possible, I'd like to incorporate a mock assignment function to add assignments in certain categories to see how one's grade would be affected by that assignment.

Also, making this sort of program more presentable would be a benefit.
Making a non-specific version (based on the AP Literature class at my school) to a grade calculator based on weighted percentages to the user's liking would also be a great move.
